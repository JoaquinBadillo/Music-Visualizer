## Contents
This repository cotains a frequency domain visualization, made with Processing and the FFT.
To use it you just need to have an mp3 file of an audio/song you like; if you don't want to play that much with the code you can just name the file `sound.mp3` and save it on the `./Visualizer/data` directory (overwrite the current file), you can also use the one I chose to play around. To look at the visualization just run the `Visualizer.pde` program and click on the run button.

Note: You will need to have Processing installed in your computer - [download here](https://processing.org/download).
